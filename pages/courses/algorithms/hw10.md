# **Due Date**: April 29, before midnight (11:59:59PM)

This assignment comprises both written questions and
implementation-based lab.

---

# HW10

Answer the following questions from the DPV book: i) Q7.17 (all parts), ii) Q7.21


# Lab10: Network Flow

Implement the Edmonds-Karp maximum flow algorithm described in
[Lecture24](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~zaki/CS2300/pdf/Lecture24-4-22-21.pdf).
In particular, for Edmonds-Karp start from the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm described in Section
7.2, with the only difference being that you need to always find the shortest
$s$-$t$ path (via BFS, assuming edge weight 1) when finding augmenting
paths (see Section 7.2.5).

Your code should output the final i) maxflow value, ii) the actual flow
along each edge from the source (print edges in sorted order, along with the
flow value on each edge).

You can test you code on the simple example from the book chapter, using
source 's' and sink 't':

    s a 3
    s b 3
    s c 4
    a d 2
    b a 10
    b d 1
    c e 5
    d c 1
    d e 1
    d t 2
    e t 5

Your output should match:

    flow ('s', 'a', 2), ('s', 'b', 1), ('s', 'c', 4)
    maxflow value 7


# Bonus 

In addition to the maxflow and the actual flow, compute the minimum cut
value and the actual capacities of the edges that cross the cut (print the
edges in sorted order, along with their capacities). For the
example graph above, the output should be:

    cut_edges ('a', 'd', 2), ('b', 'd', 1), ('s', 'c', 4)
    mincut value 7

## Grading

Use submitty to submit a PDF with the output and one .py script. 
Your code should take as input the name of
the graph file and the source and sink vertex, e.g., **lab10.py example.txt
s t**; here 's' is the source vertex and 't' the sink vertex.

Here are two other graphs to test your code:
[g5_s0_t53.txt](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~zaki/CS2300/data/g5_s0_t53.txt), and 
[g10_s0_t485.txt](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~zaki/CS2300/data/g10_s0_t485.txt). Note that the source vertex s and the sink vertex t are specified in the filename. So for *g5_s0_t53.txt* the source is '0' and sink is '53'. Treat all vertices as strings (this way the output will be consistent when you print the sorted edges in the flow/cut). The output for g5_s0_t53.txt is:

    flow ('0', '24', 59), ('0', '25', 7), ('0', '31', 44), ('0', '32', 3)
    maxflow value 113 
    
    cut_edges ('28', '53', 69), ('31', '53', 14), ('40', '41', 30)
    mincut value 113

and the output for g10_s0_t485.txt is:

    flow ('0', '103', 2), ('0', '126', 5), ('0', '136', 12), ('0', '138', 15), ('0', '158', 43), ('0', '159', 35), ('0', '184', 2), ('0', '199', 55), ('0', '20', 63), ('0', '205', 1), ('0', '218', 3), ('0', '244', 16), ('0', '249', 23), ('0', '266', 8), ('0', '276', 1), ('0', '289', 28), ('0', '290', 27), ('0', '297', 19), ('0', '305', 48), ('0', '323', 23), ('0', '343', 8), ('0', '360', 32), ('0', '368', 22), ('0', '381', 10), ('0', '387', 2), ('0', '406', 62), ('0', '415', 71), ('0', '416', 4), ('0', '429', 11), ('0', '43', 4), ('0', '435', 22), ('0', '442', 16), ('0', '444', 28), ('0', '56', 12), ('0', '58', 3), ('0', '60', 19), ('0', '68', 9), ('0', '8', 1), ('0', '88', 14)
    maxflow value 779 
    
    cut_edges ('0', '103', 2), ('0', '136', 12), ('0', '138', 15), ('0', '158', 43), ('0', '159', 35), ('0', '199', 55), ('0', '205', 1), ('0', '266', 8), ('0', '297', 19), ('0', '415', 71), ('0', '435', 22), ('100', '101', 5), ('130', '131', 5), ('184', '185', 2), ('20', '21', 57), ('20', '279', 1), ('20', '426', 5), ('221', '222', 3), ('253', '254', 16), ('253', '481', 7), ('258', '259', 16), ('277', '278', 1), ('289', '485', 28), ('292', '293', 27), ('305', '306', 48), ('323', '324', 23), ('345', '346', 6), ('357', '358', 2), ('365', '485', 3), ('367', '485', 5), ('370', '485', 16), ('371', '372', 6), ('383', '485', 10), ('390', '485', 2), ('406', '407', 61), ('406', '485', 1), ('423', '424', 4), ('429', '485', 11), ('431', '432', 24), ('44', '45', 4), ('445', '446', 28), ('473', '474', 16), ('56', '485', 12), ('59', '485', 3), ('63', '64', 19), ('70', '71', 9), ('8', '9', 1), ('88', '89', 9)
    mincut value 779



Finally, submit your output on the following graphs
[g50_s0_t2511.txt](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~zaki/CS2300/data/g50_s0_t2511.txt).
FYI, the correct value of maxflow/mincut should be 1224.
If your code is efficient, then also submit output on
[g100_s0_t12077.txt](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~zaki/CS2300/data/g100_s0_t12077.txt).
FYI, the correct value of maxflow/mincut should be 11883.

## Policy on Academic Honesty

You are free to discuss how to tackle the assignment, but all coding
must be your own. Please do not copy or modify code from anyone else,
including code on the web. Any students caught violating the academic
honesty principle will get an automatic F grade on the course and will
be referred to the dean of students for disciplinary action.
