## Introduction

This course will provide an introduction to the main topics in data
mining and knowledge discovery, including: algebraic, geometric and probabilistic
foundations, classification, regression, and clustering.
Emphasis will be laid on the algorithmic approach.


## Learning Objectives

**For CSCI-4390**: After taking this course students will be

* able to describe the fundamental data mining tasks like pattern
  mining, classification, regression and clustering

* able to analyze the key algorithms for the main tasks

* able to implement and apply the techniques to real world datasets

**For CSCI-6390**: After taking this course students will be

* able to describe the fundamental data mining tasks like pattern
  mining, classification, regression and clustering

* able to analyze the key algorithms for the main tasks

* able to implement and apply the techniques to real world datasets

* able to demonstrate understanding of more advanced topics in data
  mining

* able to implement more advanced algorithms


## Prerequisites

You need a minimum of CS2300: Introduction to Algorithms. Linear algebra
forms the foundation of data mining and machine learning, and therefore
prior exposure to linear algebra is essentially a prerequisite. A good
knowledge of probability and statistics is also a plus.

You are expected to know how to program. Class assignments will require
the use of [Python](https://www.python.org/), especially using NumPy and
PyTorch. All assignments will be submitted as [JupyterLab
Notebooks](https://jupyter.org).

## Textbook

The following textbook is **required** for the course:

[Data Mining and Machine Learning: Fundamental Concepts and Algorithms](https://dataminingbook.info/)
(2nd Edition), Mohammed J. Zaki and
Wagner Meira, Jr, Cambridge University Press, 2020.


## Grading Policy

Your grade will be a combination of the following items.

* **Assignments (30%)**: Assignments and HWs will be given throughout the
semester. These will include an implementation component and can also have
written questions. You can expect about 7-8 assignments over the semester.
 
   **Late Submissions**: Most assignments will be due just before midnight on the
   due date. Each day late will incur a 10% penalty, up to a maximum of 3 days.
   Submissions after that will not be graded.

* **Exams (60%)**: There will be three exams. The tentative exam dates are
noted on the class schedule table. There is no comprehensive final exam. Exams
will be closed book.

* **Quizzes (10%)**: There will be regular quizzes, to encourage students to
remain up-to-date on the course content.


The grading for CSCI4390 and CSCI6390 will be done separately taking
into account the more advanced material required for CSCI6390 -- this
includes extra/in-depth questions on the exam, and implementation of
more advanced algorithms for the assignments. The letter grades
typically are also based on different ranges for the two sections.

## Makeup Policy

Makeup exams will only be allowed in cases of health related issues or
other exceptional circumstances, as long as there is supporting documentation.


## Academic Integrity

Students must work independently on all course assignments. You may
consult other members of the class on the assignments, **but you must
submit your own work**. For instance you may discuss general approaches to
solving a problem, but you must implement the solution on your own.
**You are allowed to use AI tools to help you implement and test your solutions**. 
However, you must submit the tools used and the prompts along with your notebook submission.
Instances of academic integrity violations will incur a penalty that is deemed by
the instructor to be appropriate to the infraction ranging from a grade
of zero on the assignment in question, to failure of the class as a
whole. The student will also be reported to the Dean of Students or the
Dean of Graduate Education as appropriate.
