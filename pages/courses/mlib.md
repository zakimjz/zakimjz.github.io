This course focuses on machine learning algorithms for analyzing
biological data. The course will introduce the main topics in this area,
such as analysis of genome sequences, protein structures, gene networks,
and so on. We will cover some of the traditional algorithms for these
tasks, but the main focus is on the role of deep learning and data
mining in computational biology and bioinformatics.
