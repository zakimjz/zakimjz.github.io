Mohammed J. Zaki is a Professor and Department Head of `Computer Science <https://www.cs.rpi.edu>`_ at
RPI. He is also the co-director for the NSF IUCRC `Center for Research Towards Advancing Financial Technologies (CRAFT) <https://www.stevens.edu/craft>`_. He received his Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of
Rochester in 1998. His research interests focus on novel data mining and
machine learning techniques, particularly for learning from graph structured
and textual data, with applications in bioinformatics, personal health and
financial analytics. He has around 300 publications (and 6 patents),
including the `Data Mining and Machine Learning
<http://dataminingbook.info>`_ textbook (2nd Edition, Cambridge
University Press, 2020). His research has won several best paper awards and nominations, including the
`EDBT'24 Test of Time Award <https://dastlab.github.io/edbticdt2024/?contents=awards_tot_edbt.html>`_.
He is the founding co-chair for the BIOKDD
series of workshops. He has served as associate editor for several journals, including
