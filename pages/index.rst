Mohammed J. Zaki is a Professor and Department Head of Computer Science at RPI. 
He received his Ph.D. degree in computer science
from the University of Rochester in 1998. His research interests focus
on developing novel data mining and machine learning techniques,
especially for applications in text mining, social networks,
bioinformatics and personal health. He has around 300 publications (and 6
patents),
including the `Data Mining and Machine Learning
<http://dataminingbook.info>`_ textbook (2nd Edition, Cambridge
University Press, 2020). He is the founding co-chair for the BIOKDD
series of workshops. He is currently an associate editor for Data Mining
and Knowledge Discovery, and he has also served as Area Editor for
Statistical Analysis and Data Mining, and as Associate Editor for ACM
Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, and Social Networks and
Mining. He was the program co-chair for `SDM'08
