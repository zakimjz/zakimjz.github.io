    <h2>Protein Structure Prediction: Simplified AlphaFold1</h2>
<p><strong>Due Date</strong>: April 7th, before midnight</p>
<p>In this assignment, you will implement a simplified version of the
AlphaFold protein structure method. In particular, we will predict 
the distance matrix and the dihedral angles (the angle prediction is optional), 
instead of the full 3D coordinate structure.</p>
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>For training, testing and validation we will make use of the 
<a href="https://github.com/jonathanking/sidechainnet">SidechainNet Data</a>, which is
an extension of <a href="https://github.com/aqlaboratory/proteinnet">ProteinNet</a> by
including torsion angles, and side-chain information as well.
In particular, you will work with the smaller CASP7 set (but you can also use the 
larger CASP12 set). The CASP7 dataset has over 10K structures (training_30). </p>
<p>SidechainNet data includes the sequence of the protein, PSSM
info, secondary structure info, backbone coords (atomic coords of all
atoms), a boolean mask that
indicates whether the atomic coords are present or not, backbone torsion
angles, sidechain angle and coords, and so on. On campuswire I'll share the
starter script that will allow you to extract this information from the
CASP7 train, test and validation sets.</p>
<h2>Method</h2>
<p>The input to your method will be the training, validation and testing
files from SidechainNet. 
Given a protein sequence $S$ of length $L$ from the training set, you will read the input features from the
one-hot and PSSM info, etc, to create the $L \times L \times f$
tensor for the sequence $S$, where $f$ is the number of features per $(i,j)$
pair in $S$. For creating $f$, you can concatenate the features
(one-hot, PSSM, info-content, etc.) for
position $i$ and $j$, and you can also add their element-wise product
and absolute value of the difference. At least try concatenation. See if
the other alternatives improve the prediction.</p>
<p>You will next implement the residual block framework as described in the
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1923-7">AlphaFold1 paper</a>.
However, you need not train on a 220 layer network. Rather you will
train on several block groups, where each group (of 4 blocks) cycles
through the dilations of 1, 2, 4, and 8. You should make the "number of
block groups" an input parameter. So if we use 2 block groups, then your
network will be trained on 8 blocks with two cycles of dilations. Each
block should be made up of the different batch-norm, ELU, projections
and dilations as described. These layers/activations will make use of
the pytorch inbuilt functions, so you have to only define the
architecture and forward function.</p>
<p>You will train on
each $64 \times 64$ crop separately. 
You can create crops by starting at a randomly chosen 
position $(i,j)$, with $j&gt;i$ and then generating all tiles with a stride of 64
for non-overlapping crops (or 16 or
32 if you want to have overlaps between crops); this also assumes
that the input tensor has been zero padded as appropriate. You should
restrict $i$ and $j$ to be within the first 64 entries (after
zero-padding) along each dimension, to generate crops that cover the
entire protein. In particular, different epochs should start at different
$(i,j)$ positions for the same protein.
After predicting the
distances for the crops, you will compare with the true distances for
that crop only. You will first need to discretize the distances between
$2-22 A^\circ$ into 64 equal bins, with the last bin denoting distances greater than 21.6875 $A^circ$, since each bin has width $20/64 = 0.3125$. Thus, you have a  total of  64
different distance symbols. Then you can use cross-entropy loss on the
predicted probabilities and true distance symbols. 
The second head will directly predict the phi,psi angles per
position, discretized into 1296 bins.</p>
<p>You can monitor the predictions on the validation set for
hyperparameter tuning or early stopping in terms of loss.</p>
<p>For testing you should report the loss, but also the accuracy of contact
prediction. That is, a pair $(i,j)$ is in contact if the true distance
is below $8A^\circ$. So, for each test sequence, you should sum up the
probabilities in the bins corresponding to the "symbols" in the range
$2-8A^\circ$, and if that is over 0.5 then you can predict that pair to be in
contact. You can then report the accuracy for short, medium and long
range contacts in terms of distance in the sequence. 
Short is defined as $5 \le |i-j| \le 12$, medium as
$12 \le |i-j| \le 23$ and long as $|i-j| \ge 23$. In each
category, you should report the accuracy for the top $L$, $L/2$ and
$L/5$ predictions, where $L$ is the sequence length. Finally, you should
average the accuracy in each range over all of the test protein and
report that number.</p>
<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>Submit you notebook (or python script) via submitty, along with an output file (txt/pdf) that
summarizes the results of your method in terms of training and testing
accuracy values. If submitting a notebook, results can be part of the
notebook. You should report test loss, and contact map accuracy for CASP7
(if interested,  do CASP12 too).</p>
<p>You may want to use multiple GPUs to speed up your training, using the DCS
cluster.</p>
