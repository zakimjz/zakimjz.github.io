    <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This course focuses on machine learning algorithms for analyzing
biological data. The course will introduce the main topics in this area,
such as analysis of protein/DNA sequences, protein structures, molecular graphs, 
and so on. The main focus is on the role of deep learning and data
mining in computational biology and bioinformatics.</p>
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>After taking this course students will be</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>knowledgeable about the fundamental bioinformatics tasks like sequence
  and structure analysis and evolution, biological networks, and machine
  learning methods in bioinformatics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>able to understand the key algorithms for the main tasks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>able to implement and apply the techniques to real world datasets</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Prior knowledge of biology is not required. Prior exposure to linear
algebra, and probability and statistics is a plus. You will be expected
to read cutting-edge machine learning papers on the course related
topics.</p>
<p>Assignments will require the use of Python, using Numpy for numeric
computing and PyTorch (and related libraries) for deep learning. You'll be
given accounts on the CCI cluster at RPI that has state-of-the-art GPU nodes
for deep learning.</p>
<h3>Textbook</h3>
<p>There is no required text for the course. Reading materials will be posted online.
For the deep learning content, the following book is good:<br><a href="https://d2l.ai/">Dive Into Deep Learning</a>, A. Zhang, Z.C. Lipton, M. Li, A.
Smola.</p>
<h3>Grading Policy</h3>
<p>Your grade will be a combination of the following items. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Assignments and HWs (70%)</strong>: Assignments and HWs will be given
  throughout the semester. These will include an implementation
  component and can also have written questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Final Project (20%)</strong>: You will implement cutting edge approaches
  from the literature and extend/improve them. You will read papers on
  the topic, implement and compare state-of-the-art methods, and write a
  report on your findings. Finally, you will present your projects in
  class. Final projects can be done in groups of at most two students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attendance (10%)</strong>: Students are required to attend and participate
  in the class. Attendance will be taken. Late Submissions: Most assignments
  will be due just before midnight on the due date. Late assignments will be
  accepted with 15% grade penalty per day.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students auditing the course are required to complete all assignments and
projects, as well as attend the classes.</p>
<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>Students must work independently on all course assignments and projects. You
may consult other members of the class on the assignments, but you must
submit your own work. For instance you may discuss general approaches to
solving a problem, but you must implement the solution on your own
(similarity detection software may be used). Anytime you borrow material
from the web or elsewhere, you must acknowledge the source. Copying and
pasting from published sources or the internet is considered plagiarism and
is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Student-teacher relationships are built on trust. Acts which violate this
trust undermine the educational process. The Rensselaer Handbook of Student
Rights and Responsibilities and The Rensselaer Graduate Student Supplement
define various forms of Academic Dishonesty and procedures for responding to
them. Submission of any assignment that is in violation with these policies
will result in a penalty that is deemed by the instructor to be appropriate
to the infraction ranging from a grade of zero on the assignment in
question, to failure of the class as a whole. The student will also be
reported to the Dean of Students or the Dean of Graduate Education as
appropriate. If you have any questions concerning this policy before
submitting an assignment, please ask for clarification.</p>
