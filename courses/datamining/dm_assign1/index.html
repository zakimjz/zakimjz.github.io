    <h2>Assign1</h2>
<p><strong>Due Date</strong>: Sep 15th (Fri), before midnight (11:59:59PM EDT)</p>
<p>Download the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality">Wine Quality
Dataset</a> from the UCI
Machine Learning repository. Extract the winequality-red.csv datafile that
records 12 attributes about 1599 instances of red wine. You should parse and
store the data as a data matrix, after ignoring the last "quality"
attribute, which is an integer valued target variable. Thus you data matrix
will have 1599 points with 11 dimensions.</p>
<p>You must submit a self-contained jupyter notebook, with all of your <strong>code
and output</strong>. You must use NumPy, with well known/inbuilt libraries for data
input (e.g., pandas). Plots must be in inline mode (i.e., embedded) in the
notebook, using matplotlib.</p>
<h3>Part I: Basic Stats (50 Points)</h3>
<h4>a. Mean</h4>
<p>Compute the sample mean vector $\mathbf{\mu}$ for the data matrix using the
column view in $\mathbf{R}^n$. That is, project each attribute vector $X_j$
onto the ones vector $\mathbf{1}$. Verify the answer using the numpy mean
function. and then compute the total variance $var(\mathbf{D})$; see Eq.
(1.8) for the latter.</p>
<h4>b. Variance</h4>
<p>Compute the sample variance for each attribute $\sigma_j^2$ (for all
$j=1,2,...,d$) using the column view. That is, use the avg. squared norm of
the centered attribute vectors $\bar{X}_j$. Verify the answers using the
numpy var function.</p>
<p>Next, compute the total variance $var(\mathbf{D})$ (see Eq. (1.8)), and
verify that the sum of all the attribute variances equals the total
variance.</p>
<h4>c. Covariance matrix</h4>
<p>Compute the sample covariance matrix  $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ as <strong>inner
products</strong> between the attributes of the centered data matrix (see Eq.
(2.38) in chapter 2). </p>
<p>Next compute the sample covariance matrix as sum of the <strong>outer products</strong>
between the centered points (see Eq. (2.39)). </p>
<p>Print the matrix from both the approaches. You can verify your output using
numpy cov function (make sure to set rowvar as False and bias as True).</p>
<h4>d. Correlation matrix</h4>
<p>Compute the correlation matrix for this dataset using the formula for the
cosine between centered attribute vectors (see Eq. (2.30)). </p>
<p>Output which attribute pairs are i) the most correlated, ii) the most
anti-correlated, and iii) the least correlated or uncorrelated?</p>
<p>Create the scatter plots for the three interesting pairs and visually
confirm the trends, i.e., describe how each of the three cases results in a
particular type of plot.</p>
<h3>Part II: Mean via Gradient Descent (50 points)</h3>
<p>In class, we saw how the mean is the point that minimizes the sum of squared
distance to all the points in the dataset. Here, we will find the mean via
stochastic gradient descent, i.e., updating the estimate using the gradient
information from a single random point each time (or a mini-batch of
points).</p>
<h4>(CSCI 4390 Only) Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)</h4>
<p>Assume we want to find the point $\mathbf{z}$ that optimizes the squared
distance objective, but based on a single point $\mathbf{x}_i$. The the
gradient of the objective 
$$J = \frac{1}{2}||\mathbf{x_i} - \mathbf{z}||^2$$
is given as<br>
$$\nabla = \frac{\partial J}{\partial \mathbf{z}} = \mathbf{z} -
\mathbf{x}_i$$</p>
<p>To get to the minimum point, we have to update the current estimate of
$\mathbf{z}$ by taking a small step $\eta$ in a direction opposite to the
gradient $\nabla$, given as
$$ \mathbf{z} = \mathbf{z} - \eta \cdot \nabla$$
Or, 
$$\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{z} - \eta  (\mathbf{z} - \mathbf{x}_i) $$</p>
<p>So, starting from a random $\mathbf{z}$ vector, we can repeatedly sample a
single point from the data matrix (via say numpy random.choice function),
and update $\mathbf{z}$ using the equation above. </p>
<p>After every few steps (say 100 or 1000), we can compute the norm of the
difference between the previous value of $\mathbf{z}$ and its updated value,
and stop if the difference falls below a threshold $\epsilon$, at which
point, we have converged to a solution.</p>
<p>Implement this SGD algorithm, and show how close is the gradient descent
estimate of the mean from the sample mean. Show the estimated mean, and the
norm of its difference from the true mean. </p>
<p>To make this work you have to carefully choose the values of the step size
$\eta$ and the convergence threshold $\eps$. Note that if you make $\eta$
too small then you do not get good estimates, and if you make $\eps$ too
small you may never converge. You have to find a balance.</p>
<h4>(CSCI 6390 Only) Mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)</h4>
<p>You will implement the SGD, but using a mini-batch of points, rather than a
single point. Assume you sample a batch of $B$ points from the data. Then
the objective is given as</p>
<p>$$J = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^B ||\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{z}||^2$$</p>
<p>And the gradient is given as 
$$\nabla = B \cdot \mathbf{z} - \sum_{i=1}^B \mathbf{x}_i $$</p>
<p>So, starting from a random estimate of $\mathbf{z}$ you can use batches of
$B$ random points to update the estimate, using the same gradient descent
equation, but adjusted to reflect that now you are working with $B$ points,
and adjusting $\eta$ accordingly:
$$\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{z} - \frac{\eta}{B} \cdot \nabla$$
Or
$$\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{z} - \eta
\cdot \mathbf{z} + \frac{\eta}{B} \mathbf{x}_i $$</p>
<p>Implement this algorithm, and show the estimate of the optimal solution, as
well as the difference (norm) from the sample mean. To make this work you
have to carefully choose the values of the step size $\eta$ and the
convergence threshold $\eps$.</p>
<h3>Part III: Eigenvectors and Principal Components (50 Points)</h3>
<h4>a. (CSCI-4390 Only): Dominant Eigenvector and Eigenvalue</h4>
<p>Compute the dominant eigenvalue and eigenvector of the covariance matrix
$\mathbf{\Sigma}$ via the power-iteration method. One can compute the
dominant eigen-vector/-value of the covariance matrix iteratively as
follows. </p>
<p>Start from a random vector $\mathbf{x}_0 \in \mathbf{R}^d$, where $d$ is the
number of dimensions, and normalize it to be a unit vector. Set $t=0$ ($t$
denotes the iteration number).</p>
<p>Next compute the updated vector by left multiplication with the covariance
matrix:</p>
<p>$$\mathbf{x}<em t>{t+1} = \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{x}</em>$$</p>
<p>Record the ratio of the value of an element in the updated vector with
respect to the previous vector -- this is the estimate for the eigenvalue.
After computing the ratio, normalize $\mathbf{x}_{t+1}$ to be a unit vector,
increment $t$, and repeat this process. </p>
<p>To test convergence, compute the norm of the difference between the previous
and new vector the scaled vectors from the current iteration and the
previous one, and you can stop if this norm falls below some threshold
$\epsilon$</p>
<p>Print out $\mathbf{u}_1$  and $\lambda_1$.</p>
<p>Once you have obtained the dominant eigenvector, $\mathbf{u}_1$ project each
of the original data points $\mathbf{x}_i$ onto this vector, and plot the
coordinates for the new points along this "direction".</p>
<p>Separately, plot your estimate for the eigenvalue as a function of $t$.</p>
<p>Finally, compute the variance of the projected points along $\mathbf{u}_1$.
What is its relationship to $\lambda_1$.</p>
<h4>b. (CSCI-6390 Only) First Two Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues</h4>
<p>Compute the first two eigenvectors of the covariance matrix
$\mathbf{\Sigma}$ using a generalization of the above iterative method. </p>
<p>Let $\mathbf{X}_0$ be a $d \times 2$ (random) matrix with two non-zero
$d$-dimensional column vectors with unit length.  We will iteratively
multiply with $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ on the followed by orthogonalization. That
is:</p>
<p>$$\mathbf{X}_{t+1} = \mathbf{\Sigma} \; \mathbf{X}_t$$</p>
<p>where $t$ is the step size.</p>
<p>However, before doing the left multiplication, we will orthogonalize the
second column with respect to the first one by subtracting its projection
along the first column (see section 1.3.3 in chapter 1). Before the next
iteration, normalize the both columns to be unit length, and repeat the
whole process. </p>
<p>To test for convergence, you can look at the Frobenius norm between
$\mathbf{X}<em t>{t+1}$ and $\mathbf{X}</em>$. If the difference is less than some
threshold $\epsilon$ then we stop.</p>
<p>To get the eigenvalues, compute the ratio of the values in both columns
after and before update. These denote the current estimates for each of the
corresponding eigenvalues, $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$. </p>
<p>Once you have obtained the two eigenvectors: $\mathbf{u}_1$ and
$\mathbf{u}_2$, project each of the original data points $\mathbf{x}_i$ onto
those two vectors, to obtain the new projected points in 2D. Plot these
projected points in the two new dimensions. </p>
<p>Print out $\mathbf{u}_1$ and $\mathbf{u}_2$, and $\lambda_1$ and
$\lambda_2$.</p>
<p>Separately, plot the graphs for the estimates of $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$
as a function of $t$.</p>
<p>Finally, compute the variance of the projected points along $\mathbf{u}_1$
and $\mathbf{u}_2$. What is their relationship to $\lambda_1$ and
$\lambda_2$.</p>
<h3>Submission</h3>
<p>Submit your notebook via submitty, named <strong>assign1.ipynb</strong>. The notebook
should be self-contained, i.e., it should include all output from all the
parts, including figures. It should not hardcode file paths, but rather
assume that the csv datafile is in the current directory, so only the csv
filename should be used. Do not submit the datafile. </p>
<p>If you decide to consult ChatGPT (or other similar AI tools), you must
declare this, and submit a separate text/doc/PDF file documenting your
successes and failures, e.g., what prompts you tried, what worked, what did
not work, how you fixed it, etc. Name this file
<strong>declaration.[txt/pdf/doc]</strong>, choosing the correct extension.</p>
<p>For those not that familiar with python or NumPy, you may search online for
tutorials, e.g. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/ or
https://numpy.org/doc/stable/</p>
<h3>Policy on Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>You are free to discuss how to tackle the assignment, but all coding must be
your own. Any AI tool use must be declared. Any students caught violating
the academic honesty principle (e.g., code similarity, or failure to
disclose AI tools) will get an automatic F grade on the course and will be
referred to the dean of students for disciplinary action.</p>
