<h1>Assign5: Pattern Mining and Clustering</h1>
<p><strong>Due Date</strong>: Nov 20, before midnight (11:59:59PM)</p>
<hr>
<h1>Closed Itemset Mining</h1>
<p>Implement the closed itemset mining algorithm 9.2 on page 251. For example,
given the dataset:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">A B D E
B C E
A B D E
A B C E
A B C D E
B C D
</pre></div>

<p>You can assume that each line has a transaction -- a set of items, separated
by spaces. For minimum support of 3, the set of closed itemsets should be printed out
in the format:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">A,B,D,E - 3
A,B,E - 4
B,D - 4
B,C,E - 3
B,C - 4
B,E - 5
B - 6
Number of closed itemsets: 7
</pre></div>

<p>Show the frequent closed itemsets on the
<a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~zaki/DMCOURSE/data/chess.txt">chess.txt</a> dataset, using
minimum support 3000.</p>

<h1>Expectation Maximization Clustering</h1>
<p>Implement the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for clustering
(see Algorithm 13.3 in Chapter 13). </p>
<p>For initializing the clusters, select $k$ random data points as the cluster
centers. However, once you have chosen the centers, assign each point to the
closest center to compute the covariance matrix and the prior probabilities
of each cluster.</p>
<p>For practical purposes, you may want to use the <a href="https://blog.feedly.com/tricks-of-the-trade-logsumexp/">logexpsum
trick</a> for
expectation step, where you compute the log probabilities so that you can
deal with very small probability values, otherwise, you may find that
weights of a point for the clusters are zero. That is, if all probabilities
are given as $\log P(Ci)$ and $\log P(xj | Ci)$, 
then we have
first compute $\log w_{ij}' = \log P(xj | Ci) + \log P(Ci)$ (note: this is
only the numerator, we have to normalize as given below). But, to compute
the final $w_{ij}$, we have to use the logsumexp trick, since 
$$logsumexp(\log w_{1j}', \log w_{2j}', ..., \log w_{kj}') = \log\left(\sum_{a=1}^k
        \exp \log w_{aj}'\right) = \log \left(\sum_{a=1}^k w_{aj}'\right)$$
And therefore,
$$w_{ij} = \exp\Big( \log w_{ij}' - logsumexp(\log w_{1j}', ..., \log w_{kj}') \Big)$$
You can therefore use scipy.special.logsumexp function on log probabilities.</p>
<p>As another practical point, you can get an error when inverting the covariance
matrix, so you should add a small ridge value $\lambda$ value along the
diagonal entries to make the matrix invertible. This can be considered
as a regularized estimate of the covariance matrix, i.e., $$\Sigma +
\lambda \mathbf{I}$$
Or just use scipy.stats.multivariate_normal.logpdf with <em>allow_singular</em> flag set to True.</p>
<p>Apply your algorithm on the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris">Iris
Dataset</a>, using $k=3$ clusters. Use only the first
four columns as the data points, and keep aside the last
column -- the class label -- only for computing the cluster evaluation metric. Your output should comprise the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>The final mean for each cluster</li>
<li>The final covariance matrix for each cluster</li>
<li>Size of each cluster, after assigning  each point to the cluster with highest posterior probability $P(c_i | x_j)$.</li>
<li>The Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) score for your clustering.
    CSCI4390 can use <em>sklearn.metrics.normalized_mutual_info_score</em>*, but
    CSCI6390 must implement this based on Eq. 17.8 in the book.</li>
</ul>
<p>Run your code several times (due to the different random initial center
selections),  and report the clustering with the best NMI score.</p>

<h2>Policy on Academic Honesty</h2>
<p>You are free to discuss how to tackle the assignment, but all coding
must be your own. Please do not copy or modify code from anyone else,
including code on the web. Any students caught violating the academic
honesty principle will get an automatic F grade on the course and will
be referred to the dean of students for disciplinary action. If you do use
AI tools, you must document the details.</p>
