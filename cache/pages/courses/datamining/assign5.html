<h1>Assign5: Support Vector Regression</h1>
<p><strong>Due Date</strong>: Oct 21, before midnight (11:59:59PM)</p>
<p>We will continue with the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+news+popularity">Online News Popularity</a>
dataset as in previous assignments. This dataset has 61 attributes and 39644
points. 
Ignore the following attributes for this assignment: 0-1,
4-6, 13-38. We will use all the remaining attributes, but with the last attribute
(60; shares) as the target variable. Thus you will have 29 independent
attributes and 1 dependent or target attribute. Your goal is to build a
regression model to predict the number of shares of a news article.</p>
<p>First, follow the same data preprocessing steps outlined in <a href="/courses/datamining/dm_assign4/">CSCI4390-6390 Assign4</a>, except that you should split the data into three parts after shuffling the points, by taking 
the first 5000 points as
training data, the next 2000 points as validation data, and the next 5000
points as the test data. You can ignore the remaining points.</p>
<p>You will implement the dual SVM Algorithm 21.1 (Chapter 21, page 540).
You must implement the hinge loss case.</p>
<h2>CSCI4390 and CSCI6390</h2>
<p>You must implement two kernels, namely, both linear and Gaussian.
You must select the best $C$ value using the validation set, and the same
goes for the spread parameter $\sigma^2$ for the Gaussian kernel.</p>
<h2>CSCI6390</h2>
<p>You must also implement the polynomial kernel. You need to select the best degree and $C$ value.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What to submit</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Submit your python notebook, that contains the solution and output, 
suitably annotated/commented. Name the notebook: <strong>assign5.ipynb</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submit the notebook file via submitty. Your code must be self-contained,
    and must not hard code file names. You can assume the data file lies in
    the local dir.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Policy on Academic Honesty</h2>
<p>You are free to discuss how to tackle the assignment, but all coding
must be your own. Please do not copy or modify code from anyone else,
including code on the web. Any students caught violating the academic
honesty principle will get an automatic F grade on the course and will
be referred to the dean of students for disciplinary action.</p>
