<h1>Assign5: Bayes Classifier</h1>
<p><strong>Due Date</strong>: Oct 31, before midnight (11:59:59PM)</p>
<hr>
<h3>Dataset</h3>
<p>Download the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/851/steel+industry+energy+consumption">Steel Industry Energy Consumption
Dataset</a> from the UCI
Machine Learning repository. Extract the Steel_industry_data.csv datafile. You should parse and
store the data as a data matrix, focusing only on the 6 continuous
attributes (see datafile or link above for names/descriptions). Thus, your data matrix
will have 35040 points in 6 dimensions. However, in addition you should
record the last attribute (load type) for each point. We will use this as
the class label.</p>
<p>You should first randomly shuffle all points, and then take
the first 80% of the data as training and the remaining 20% as testing.
You must do this via <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html">sklearn.train_test_split</a>, using 42 as the random_state.</p>

<h2>Part I: Bayes Classifier</h2>
<p>Implement both the full Bayes classifier in Algo 18.1, and the naive Bayes
classifier in Algo 18.2.</p>
<p>Students in CSCI6390, should in addition, implement the K-nearest-neighbor
classifier, and present the best results trying different K values.</p>
<p>Estimate parameters using the training data, and
report the accuracy of the testing set. You must report total accuracy, and
the class-specific accuracy and recall values -- see Eq 22.3 and 22.4 for
the later two. Report these values for all methods.</p>
<p>You may use <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.multivariate_normal.html">scipy multivariate_normal.pdf</a> to compute the normal probability density function.</p>

<h2>Policy on Academic Honesty</h2>
<p>You are free to discuss how to tackle the assignment, but all coding must be
your own. Any AI tool use must be declared. Any students caught violating
the academic honesty principle (e.g., code similarity, or failure to
disclose AI tools) will get an automatic F grade on the course and will be
referred to the dean of students for disciplinary action.</p>
