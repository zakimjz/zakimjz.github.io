<h1>Assign5: Neural Nets (MLP)</h1>
<p><strong>Due Date</strong>: Nov 1, before midnight (11:59:59PM, Alofi Time; GMT-11)</p>
<p>You will use the 
<a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Appliances+energy+prediction#">Appliances energy prediction data set</a>.
You should ignore the first attribute, which is a date-time variable,
and you should also remove the last attribute, which is a duplicate of
the previous one. Use the first attribute (after removing the
date-time variable), which denotes the
<strong>Appliances Energy Use</strong>, as the response variable, with the remaining
attributes as predictor variables. However, you have to discretize the
response variable differently for the two sections as noted below, since
CSCI4390 will implement binary classification, whereas CSCI6390
will implement multiclass classification via MLP.</p>
<hr>
<h2>CSCI4390: Binary Classification</h2>
<p>You will implement binary classification via the MLP training 
Algorithm 25.1 (Chapter 25, page 655). The only difference is that you
must use ReLU activation for the hidden layer, whereas the output layer
will use sigmoid as described in the algorithm. The only place where
this has an effect is line 11, where you must use the RelU derivative in
place of $\mathbf{z_i} \odot (\mathbf{1}-\mathbf{z_i})$.</p>
<p>Note that the <strong>Appliances Energy Use</strong> attribute takes values in the
range $[10,1080]$. However, for binary classification, we need only two
values, so for the purpose of this assignment you should consider energy
use less than or equal to 50 as the positive class (1), and energy use
higher than 50 as negative class (0). </p>
<p>You should shuffle the data points before selecting 70% of the data
training and 30% for testing, so that there is an equal mix of the
classes in both.</p>
<h2>CSCI6390: Multiclass Classification</h2>
<p>You will implement multiclass classification via the deep MLP algorithm in
Algorithm 25.2 (Chapter 25, page 668). You should use ReLU activation
for all hidden layers, and softmax for the output layer.</p>
<p>Note that the <strong>Appliances Energy Use</strong> attribute takes values in the
range $[10,1080]$. However, for multiclass regression, we will convert
these into four classes as follows: energy use less than or equal to 30
is class $c_1$, energy use greater than 30 but less than or equal to 50
is class $c_2$, energy use greater than 50 but less than or equal to 100
is class $c_3$, and finally energy use higher than 100 is class $c_4$.
You need to do this conversion to create the categorical response
variable, before you select the train (70%) and test (30%) subsets.</p>
<p>You should shuffle the data points before selecting 70% of the data
training and 30% for testing, so that there is an equal mix of the
classes in both.</p>

<h2>What to submit</h2>
<ul>
<li>Write a scripy named as <strong>Assign5.py</strong>, which will be run as <pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err"> Assign5.py FILENAME ETA MAXITER HIDDENSIZE for CSCI4390</span>
<span class="err"> Assign5.py FILENAME ETA MAXITER HIDDENSIZE NUMHIDDEN for CSCI6390</span>
</pre>

</li>
</ul>
<p>FILENAME is the datafile name,  ETA is the
 step size $\eta$, 
 MAXITER is the number of epochs to train the model, HIDDENSIZE is the
 size of the hidden layer, and NUMHIDDEN is the number of hidden layers
 (this is for CSCI6390). CSCI6390 students may assume that all hidden
 layers use the same size.</p>
<p>Your script should print out the weight matrices and biases for each
layer, and also the final
accuracy value on the test data, where you use 70% of the data for
training and 30% for testing.</p>
<p>Note that accuracy is defined as the fraction of correct class label
predictions. So for each test point, you should predict its class as the
one that has the highest probability, and then you should count how many
test points are correctly predicted. Divide that number by the test data
size to get the accuracy. Report the
results for the combination of ETA and HIDDENSIZE that yields the best
accuracy.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Submit a PDF file named Assign5.pdf that should include your answers
 to each of the questions (just cut and paste the output from python).
 <strong>Failure the submit the PDF will result in lost points.</strong> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submit the scripts and pdf file via submitty</p>

<h2>Policy on Academic Honesty</h2>
<p>You are free to discuss how to tackle the assignment, but all coding
must be your own. Please do not copy or modify code from anyone else,
including code on the web. Any students caught violating the academic
honesty principle will get an automatic F grade on the course and will
be referred to the dean of students for disciplinary action.</p>
