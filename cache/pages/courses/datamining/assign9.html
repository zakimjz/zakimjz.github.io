<h1>Assign9: Clustering: Density and MCL</h1>
<p><strong>Due Date</strong>: Dec 5, before midnight (11:59:59PM)</p>
<p>You will use the 
<a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Codon+usage#">Codon Usage Dataset</a>.
You should use Column 1 as the true cluster label. Next ignore
Columns 2, 3, 4, and 5. Use the remaining 64 attributes as the 64
dimensional feature vector per point. Since Column 1 is the animal kingdom,
you are trying to group the points based on the DNA codon frequencies.
Also, there are some data errors on lines 488 and 5065 (if header is assumed
to be line 1). You should ignore
those lines after reading in the data (<strong>do not modify the input file</strong>).
Use Col 1 as the true cluster labels, so
there are 11 true clusters.
You should also scale your points to be between 0 and 1 using 
<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html#sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler">sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler</a>.</p>

<h1>CSCI4390/6390: Density Clustering</h1>
<p>Implement the DENCLUE density-based clustering algorithm given in 
Algorithm 15.2 on page 388. </p>
<p>Use mean-shift updates to compute the attractor for each point. Use
logsumexp as needed.</p>
<p>Once you have computed the attractors, for step 7 where you check for
density reachable, you should basically merge two attractors (and all points
attracted to them) using a distance threshold $\theta$. That is, two
attractors that are within $\theta$ distance of each other should be merged
together into a single cluster. Thus, each cluster will be given by a set of
attractors (along with all points attracted to any one of them).</p>
<p>Note that this method does not use the number of clusters as input, so you
need to choose $\theta$ carefully to report the final clustering.
Run your code using different thresholds and report the clustering with the best NMI score.</p>
<p>Your program output should consist of the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of clusters.</li>
<li>Size of each cluster.</li>
<li>The Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) score for your clustering,
    computed using Eq. 17.8. You must implement this on your own, but you
    can confirm your answer using <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.normalized_mutual_info_score.html">sklearn.metrics.normalized_mutual_info_score</a> using 'geometric' as average_method.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that while you can try to obtain 11 clusters, this may not always be
possible, since it depends on the threshold. It is not required that you
always find 11 clusters. </p>

<h1>CSCI6390 Only: Markov Clustering (MCL)</h1>
<p>In addition, implement the MCL algorithm 16.2 on pg 420. 
Note that this method does not use the number of clusters as input, so you
need to choose the inflation parameter $r$ carefully to report the final clustering.
Run your code using different $r$ values and report the clustering with the best NMI score.</p>
<p>Your program output should consist of the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of clusters.</li>
<li>Size of each cluster.</li>
<li>The Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) score for your clustering,
    computed using Eq. 17.8. You must implement this on your own, but you
    can confirm your answer using <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.normalized_mutual_info_score.html">sklearn.metrics.normalized_mutual_info_score</a> using 'geometric' as average_method.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that while you can try to obtain 11 clusters, this may not always be
possible, since it depends on the $r$ value. It is not required that you
always find 11 clusters. </p>

<h2>Policy on Academic Honesty</h2>
<p>You are free to discuss how to tackle the assignment, but all coding
must be your own. Please do not copy or modify code from anyone else,
including code on the web. Any students caught violating the academic
honesty principle will get an automatic F grade on the course and will
be referred to the dean of students for disciplinary action.</p>
