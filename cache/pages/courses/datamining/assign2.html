<h1>Assign2: High Dimensional Data and Dimensionality Reduction</h1>
<p><strong>Due Date</strong>: Sep 22, before midnight (11:59:59PM, Alofi Time; GMT-11)</p>
<p>Both Part I and II have to be done by all sections. Differences have
been specified by <strong>CSCI4390</strong> and <strong>CSCI6390</strong> labels. </p>
<hr>
<h2>Part I: Principal Components Analysis (50 points)</h2>
<p>You will implement the PCA algorithm as
 described in Algorithm 7.1 (Chapter 7). You need to compute
 the eigenvectors, and then project and visualize the data. To
 compute the principal components (PCs), you may
 use the inbuilt numpy function <strong>eigh</strong>.</p>
<p>Run PCA on the 
<a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Appliances+energy+prediction#">Appliances energy prediction data set</a>
You should ignore the first attribute, which is a date-time variable,
and you should also remove the last attribute, which is a duplicate of
the previous one.</p>
<p>Next, determine and print how many dimensions are required
 to capture $\alpha=0.975$ fraction of the total variance? </p>
<p>Also print the mean squared error in the approximation using
the first three components.</p>
<h3>Plot the PCs</h3>
<p><strong>CSCI4390 Only</strong>: Project the points along the first two PCs, and create
a scatter plot of the projected points.</p>
<p><strong>CSCI64390 Only</strong>: Project the points along the first three PCs, and create
a 3D scatter plot of the projected points.</p>

<h2>Part II: Diagonals in High Dimensions (50 points)</h2>
<p>Your goal is the compute the probability mass function for the random
variable $X$ that represents the angle (in degrees) between any two
diagonals in high dimensions.</p>
<p>Assume that there are $d$ primary dimensions (the standard axes in
cartesian coordinates), with each of them ranging from -1 to 1.  There
are $2^{d}$ additional half-diagonals in this space, one for each
corner of the $d$-dimensional hypercube.</p>
<p>Randomly generate
 $n=100,000$ pairs of
half-diagonals in the d-dimensional hypercube, and compute the angle
between them (in degrees). </p>
<p>Plot the probability mass
 function (PMF) for three different
values of $d$, as follows $d={10,100,1000}$. Recall that PMF is
simply the plot of the angle versus the probability of observing that
angle in the sample of $n$ points for a given value of $d$. What is
the min, max, value range, mean and variance of $X$ for each value of
$d$?</p>
<p><strong>CSCI6390 Only</strong>:  What would expect analytically? In other
words, derive formulas for what should happen to angle between
half-diagonals as $d \to \infty$. Does the PMF conform to this trend?
Explain why? or why not?</p>

<h2>What to submit</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Write two python scripts named as Assign2-part1.py and
 Assign2-part2.py, one for each of the parts. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For part1, read the filename from the command line, assume it is in
 the local directory. So, part1 will be run as </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assign2-part1.py FILENAME ALPHA</strong>. FILENAME is the datafile name, and ALPHA is the
 approximation threshold $\alpha$. </p>
<p>In other words, you script must
 compute and return the correct number of components to capture $\alpha$
 fraction of total variance. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For part2, the script will be run as <strong>Assign2-part2.py</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submit a PDF file named Assign2.pdf that should include your solutions
 to each of the questions (just cut and paste the output from python).
 The figures should also be part of this file. <strong>Failure the submit the
 PDF will result in lost points.</strong> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submit the scripts and pdf file via submitty</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Policy on Academic Honesty</h2>
<p>You are free to discuss how to tackle the assignment, but all coding
must be your own. Please do not copy or modify code from anyone else,
including code on the web. Any students caught violating the academic
honesty principle will get an automatic F grade on the course and will
be referred to the dean of students for disciplinary action.</p>
