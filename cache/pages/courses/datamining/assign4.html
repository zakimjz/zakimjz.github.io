<h1>Assign4: Logistic Regression</h1>
<p><strong>Due Date</strong>: Oct 16, before midnight (11:59:59PM, Alofi Time; GMT-11)</p>
<p>You will use the 
<a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Appliances+energy+prediction#">Appliances energy prediction data set</a>.
You should ignore the first attribute, which is a date-time variable,
and you should also remove the last attribute, which is a duplicate of
the previous one. 
For Logistic Regression, use the first attribute (after removing the
date-time variable), which denotes the
<strong>Appliances Energy Use</strong>, as the response variables, with the remaining
attributes as predictor variables. However, you have to discretize the
response variable differently for the two sections as noted below, since
CSCI4390 will implement binary logistic regression, whereas CSCI6390
will implement multiclass logistic regression.</p>
<hr>
<h2>CSCI4390: Binary Logistic Regression</h2>
<p>You will implement the binary logistic regression algorithm as described in
Algorithm 24.1 (Chapter 24, page 628). </p>
<p>Note that the <strong>Appliances Energy Use</strong> attribute takes values in the
range $[10,1080]$. However, for binary regression, we need only two
values, so for the purpose of this assignment you should consider energy
use less than or equal to 50 as the positive class (1), and energy use
higher than 50 as negative class (0). You need to do this conversion to
create the binary response variable, before you select the train (70%)
and test (30%) subsets.</p>
<h2>CSCI6390: Multiclass Logistic Regression</h2>
<p>You will implement the binary logistic regression algorithm as described in
Algorithm 24.2 (Chapter 24, page 634). </p>
<p>Note that the <strong>Appliances Energy Use</strong> attribute takes values in the
range $[10,1080]$. However, for multiclass regression, we will convert
these into four classes as follows: energy use less than or equal to 30
is class $c_1$, energy use greater than 30 but less than or equal to 50
is class $c_2$, energy use greater than 50 but less than or equal to 100
is class $c_3$, and finally energy use higher than 100 is class $c_4$.
You need to do this conversion to create the categorical response
variable, before you select the train (70%) and test (30%) subsets.</p>

<h2>What to submit</h2>
<ul>
<li>Write a scripy named as <strong>Assign4.py</strong>, which will be run as 
 <strong>Assign4.py FILENAME ETA EPS MAXITER</strong>. FILENAME is the datafile name,  ETA is the
 step size $\eta$, EPS is the convergence threshold $\epsilon$, and
 MAXITER is the upper bound on the number of iterations when learning
 the weights (i.e., terminate after MAXITER even if the EPS threshold
 has not been reached).</li>
</ul>
<p>Your script should print out the weight vector(s), and also the final
accuracy value on the test data, where you use 70% of the data for
training and 30% for testing.</p>
<p>Note that accuracy is defined as the fraction of correct class label
predictions. So for each test point, you should predict its class as the
one that has the highest probability, and then you should count how many
test points are correctly predicted. Divide that number of the test data
size to get the accuracy.</p>
<p>You should try different $\eta$ and $\epsilon$ values and report the best
results.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Submit a PDF file named Assign4.pdf that should include your answers
 to each of the questions (just cut and paste the output from python).
 <strong>Failure the submit the PDF will result in lost points.</strong> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submit the scripts and pdf file via submitty</p>

<h2>Policy on Academic Honesty</h2>
<p>You are free to discuss how to tackle the assignment, but all coding
must be your own. Please do not copy or modify code from anyone else,
including code on the web. Any students caught violating the academic
honesty principle will get an automatic F grade on the course and will
be referred to the dean of students for disciplinary action.</p>
