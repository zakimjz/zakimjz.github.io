<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This course will provide an introduction to the main topics in data
mining and knowledge discovery, including: algebraic, geometric and probabilistic
foundations, classification, regression, and clustering.
Emphasis will be laid on the algorithmic approach.</p>
<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p><strong>For CSCI-4390</strong>: After taking this course students will be</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>able to describe the fundamental data mining tasks like pattern
  mining, classification, regression and clustering</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>able to analyze the key algorithms for the main tasks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>able to implement and apply the techniques to real world datasets</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For CSCI-6390</strong>: After taking this course students will be</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>able to describe the fundamental data mining tasks like pattern
  mining, classification, regression and clustering</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>able to analyze the key algorithms for the main tasks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>able to implement and apply the techniques to real world datasets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>able to demonstrate understanding of more advanced topics in data
  mining</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>able to implement more advanced algorithms</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>You need a minimum of CS2300: Introduction to Algorithms. Linear algebra
forms the foundation of data mining and machine learning, and therefore
prior exposure to linear algebra is essentially a prerequisite. A good
knowledge of probability and statistics is also a plus.</p>
<p>You are expected to know how to program. Class assignments will require
the use of <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, especially using NumPy and
PyTorch. All assignments will be submitted as <a href="https://jupyter.org">JupyterLab
Notebooks</a>.</p>
<h2>Textbook</h2>
<p>The following textbook is <strong>required</strong> for the course:</p>
<p><a href="https://dataminingbook.info/">Data Mining and Machine Learning: Fundamental Concepts and Algorithms</a>
(2nd Edition), Mohammed J. Zaki and
Wagner Meira, Jr, Cambridge University Press, 2020.</p>
<h2>Grading Policy</h2>
<p>Your grade will be a combination of the following items.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assignments (30%)</strong>: Assignments and HWs will be given throughout the
semester. These will include an implementation component and can also have
written questions. You can expect about 7-8 assignments over the semester.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Late Submissions</strong>: Most assignments will be due just before midnight on the
   due date. Each day late will incur a 10% penalty, up to a maximum of 3 days.
   Submissions after that will not be graded.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Exams (60%)</strong>: There will be three exams. The tentative exam dates are
noted on the class schedule table. There is no comprehensive final exam. Exams
will be closed book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quizzes (10%)</strong>: There will be regular quizzes, to encourage students to
remain up-to-date on the course content.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The grading for CSCI4390 and CSCI6390 will be done separately taking
into account the more advanced material required for CSCI6390 -- this
includes extra/in-depth questions on the exam, and implementation of
more advanced algorithms for the assignments. The letter grades
typically are also based on different ranges for the two sections.</p>
<h2>Makeup Policy</h2>
<p>Makeup exams will only be allowed in cases of health related issues or
other exceptional circumstances, as long as there is supporting documentation.</p>
<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Students must work independently on all course assignments. You may
consult other members of the class on the assignments, <strong>but you must
submit your own work</strong>. For instance you may discuss general approaches to
solving a problem, but you must implement the solution on your own.
<strong>You are allowed to use AI tools to help you implement and test your solutions</strong>. 
However, you must submit the tools used and the prompts along with your notebook submission.
Instances of academic integrity violations will incur a penalty that is deemed by
the instructor to be appropriate to the infraction ranging from a grade
of zero on the assignment in question, to failure of the class as a
whole. The student will also be reported to the Dean of Students or the
Dean of Graduate Education as appropriate.</p>
