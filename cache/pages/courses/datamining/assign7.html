<h1>Assign7: Logistic Regression</h1>
<p><strong>Due Date</strong>: Nov 18, before midnight (11:59:59PM)</p>
<hr>
<h3>Dataset</h3>
<p>Download the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/851/steel+industry+energy+consumption">Steel Industry Energy Consumption
Dataset</a> from the UCI
Machine Learning repository. Extract the Steel_industry_data.csv datafile. You should parse and
store the data as a data matrix, focusing only on the 6 continuous
attributes (see datafile or link above for names/descriptions). Thus, your data matrix
will have 35040 points in 6 dimensions. However, in addition you should
record the last attribute (load type) for each point. We will use this as
the class label.</p>
<p>Use
<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html">sklearn.train_test_split</a>,
using 42 as the random_state, to shuffle and create the training and
testing data, using 80-20 split (i.e., 80% of the data as training and the
remaining 20% as testing).</p>
<hr>
<h2>Part I: Logistic Regression</h2>
<p>Implement the multi-class logistic regression algorithm as described in
Algorithm 24.2 (Chapter 24, page 634).</p>
<p>Your script should print out the weight vector(s), and also the final
accuracy value on the test data (see Eq 22.2). You should also compute the
F1-score (see Eq 22.7 in chapter 22).</p>
<p>You should use the scipy.special.softmax function rather than your own,
since it is more robust.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Part II: Questions</h2>
<p>Submit your solutions to the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 24: Q2</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>What to submit</h2>
<ul>
<li>Submit your notebook named as <strong>assign7.ipynb</strong>. Include your
    paper-pencil answers as images in the notebook as well.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Policy on Academic Honesty</h2>
<p>You are free to discuss how to tackle the assignment, but all coding must be
your own. Any AI tool use must be declared. Any students caught violating
the academic honesty principle (e.g., code similarity, or failure to
disclose AI tools) will get an automatic F grade on the course and will be
referred to the dean of students for disciplinary action.</p>
