    abstract = {In this paper, we propose an end-to-end graph learning framework, namely Deep Iterative and Adaptive Learning for Graph Neural Networks (DIAL-GNN), for jointly learning the graph structure and graph embeddings simultaneously. We first cast the graph structure learning problem as a similarity metric learning problem and leverage an adapted graph regularization for controlling smoothness, connectivity and sparsity of the generated graph. We further propose a novel iterative method for searching for a hidden graph structure that augments the initial graph structure. Our iterative method dynamically stops when the learned graph structure approaches close enough to the optimal graph. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DIAL-GNN model can consistently outperform or match state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both downstream task performance and computational time. The proposed approach can cope with both transductive learning and inductive learning.},

                potential to mislead traditional sentiment analysis and

    abstract = {Conversational machine comprehension (MC) has proven
                significantly more challenging compared to traditional
                MC since it requires better utilization of conversation
                history. However, most existing approaches do not
                effectively capture conversation history and thus have
                trouble handling questions in- volving coreference or
                ellipsis. Moreover, when reasoning over passage text,
                most of them simply treat it as a word sequence without
                exploring rich semantic relationships among words. In
                this paper, we first propose a simple yet effective
                graph struc- ture learning technique to dynamically
                construct a question and conversation history aware
                context graph at each conversation turn. Then we propose
                a novel Recurrent Graph Neural Network, and based on
                that, we introduce a flow mechanism to model the
                temporal dependencies in a sequence of context graphs.
                The proposed G RAPH F LOW model can ef- fectively
                capture conversational flow in a dialog, and shows
                competitive performance compared to existing
                state-of-the-art methods on CoQA, QuAC and DoQA

Learning pretrained recipe embeddings is a challenging task, as

we provide a joint approach for learning effective pretrained recipe
embeddings using both the ingredients and cooking instructions.
We present Reciptor, a novel set transformer-based joint model to
learn recipe representations, that preserves permutation-invariance
for the ingredient set and uses a novel knowledge graph (KG) derived 
triplet sampling approach to optimize the learned embeddings
so that related recipes are closer in the latent semantic space. The
embeddings are further jointly optimized by combining similarity 
among cooking instructions with a KG based triplet loss. We
experimentally show that Reciptor’s recipe embeddings outperform 
state-of-the-art baselines on two newly designed downstream
classification tasks by a wide margin.},

                crucial health factors (e.g., allergies and nutrition

                for recommending healthy recipes. To address these

                question answering over a large-scale food knowledge

                a unified way as additional constraints to the QA

    abstract = {The mushroom body of the fruit fly brain is one of the best studied systems in neuroscience. At its core it consists of a population of Kenyon cells, which receive inputs from multiple sensory modalities. These cells are inhibited by the anterior paired lateral neuron, thus creating a sparse high dimensional representation of the inputs. In this work we study a mathematical formalization of this network motif and apply it to learning the correlational structure between words and their context in a corpus of unstructured text, a common natural language processing (NLP) task. We show that this network can learn semantic representations of words and can generate both static and context-dependent word embeddings. Unlike conventional methods (e.g., BERT, GloVe) that use dense representations for word embedding, our algorithm encodes semantic meaning of words and their context in the form of sparse binary hash codes. The quality of the learned representations is evaluated on word similarity analysis, word-sense disambiguation, and document classification. It is shown that not only can the fruit fly network motif achieve performance comparable to existing methods in NLP, but, additionally, it uses only a fraction of the computational resources (shorter training time and smaller memory footprint).},

              collection of data and the generation of meaningful summaries
